From 84c9048842ec35942523be439416e510be15964b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: [PATCH] workflows: We all love checkpatch, so add it to the CI
 workflows

This is currently running on defaults, so the --strict desired
for media drivers and similar won't be observed. That may be
possible to add later.
