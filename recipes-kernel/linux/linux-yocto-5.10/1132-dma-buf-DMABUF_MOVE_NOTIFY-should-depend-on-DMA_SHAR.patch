Subject: [PATCH 1132/2201] dma-buf: DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY should depend on
 DMA_SHARED_BUFFER

[ Upstream commit c4f3a3460a5daebc772d9263500e4099b11e7300 ]

Move notify between drivers is an option of DMA-BUF.  Enabling
DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY without DMA_SHARED_BUFFER does not have any impact,
as drivers/dma-buf/ is not entered during the build when
DMA_SHARED_BUFFER is disabled.
