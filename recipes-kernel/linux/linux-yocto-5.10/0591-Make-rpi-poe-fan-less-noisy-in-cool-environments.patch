Subject: [PATCH 0591/2201] Make rpi poe fan less noisy in cool environments
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Run the PoE hat fan with reduced noise when possible. The PoE hat fan will spin even at PWM=1 and spins almost silent. Tested at 17ÂºC, the fan PWM alternates between 1 and 10, which is a lot less noisy then alternating between PWM levels 0 and 31.
