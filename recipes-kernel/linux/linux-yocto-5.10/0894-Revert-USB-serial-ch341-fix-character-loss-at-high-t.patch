Subject: [PATCH 0894/2201] Revert "USB: serial: ch341: fix character loss at
 high transfer rates"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit df7b16d1c00ecb3da3a30c999cdb39f273c99a2f upstream.

This reverts commit 3c18e9baee0ef97510dcda78c82285f52626764b.

These devices do not appear to send a zero-length packet when the
transfer size is a multiple of the bulk-endpoint max-packet size. This
means that incoming data may not be processed by the driver until a
short packet is received or the receive buffer is full.

Revert back to using endpoint-sized receive buffers to avoid stalled
reads.
