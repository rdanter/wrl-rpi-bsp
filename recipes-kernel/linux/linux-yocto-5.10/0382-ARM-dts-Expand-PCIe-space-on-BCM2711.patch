Subject: [PATCH 0382/2201] ARM: dts: Expand PCIe space on BCM2711

Attempts to connect external GPUs to Compute Module 4's PCIe bus have
highlighted that the existing "outbound window" - the fraction of the
PCI address base that is appears in the host's memory map - is
restrictively small. Expand the window to a full 1GB.
