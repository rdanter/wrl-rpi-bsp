Subject: [PATCH 1438/2201] ARM: boot: dts: bcm2711: Fix HVS register range

[ Upstream commit 515415d316168c6521d74ea8280287e28d7303e6 ]

While the HVS has the same context memory size in the BCM2711 than in
the previous SoCs, the range allocated to the registers doubled and it
now takes 16k + 16k, compared to 8k + 16k before.

The KMS driver will use the whole context RAM though, eventually
resulting in a pointer dereference error when we access the higher half
of the context memory since it hasn't been mapped.
