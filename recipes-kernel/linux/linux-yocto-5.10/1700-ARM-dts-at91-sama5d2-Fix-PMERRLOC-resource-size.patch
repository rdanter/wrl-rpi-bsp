Subject: [PATCH 1700/2201] ARM: dts: at91: sama5d2: Fix PMERRLOC resource size

commit 0fb578a529ac7aca326a9fa475b4a6f58a756fda upstream.

PMERRLOC resource size was set to 0x100, which resulted in HSMC_ERRLOCx
register being truncated to offset x = 21, causing error correction to
fail if more than 22 bit errors and if 24 or 32 bit error correction
was supported.

Fixes: d9c41bf30cf8 ("ARM: dts: at91: Declare EBI/NAND controllers")
