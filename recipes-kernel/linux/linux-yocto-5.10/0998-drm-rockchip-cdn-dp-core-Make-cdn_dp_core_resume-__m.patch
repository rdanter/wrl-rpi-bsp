Subject: [PATCH 0998/2201] drm/rockchip: cdn-dp-core: Make cdn_dp_core_resume
 __maybe_unused

commit 040b8907ccf1c78d020aca29800036565d761d73 upstream.

With the new static annotation, the compiler warns when the functions
are actually unused:

   drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/cdn-dp-core.c:1123:12: error: 'cdn_dp_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
    1123 | static int cdn_dp_resume(struct device *dev)
         |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mark them __maybe_unused to suppress that warning as well.

[ Not so 'new' static annotations any more, and I removed the part of
  the patch that added __maybe_unused to cdn_dp_suspend(), because it's
  used by the shutdown/remove code.

  So only the resume function ends up possibly unused if CONFIG_PM isn't
  set     - Linus ]
