Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Check dst_port only on the client socket

commit 2d2202ba858c112b03f84d546e260c61425831a1 upstream.

cgroup_skb/egress programs which sock_fields test installs process packets
flying in both directions, from the client to the server, and in reverse
direction.

Recently added dst_port check relies on the fact that destination
port (remote peer port) of the socket which sends the packet is known ahead
of time. This holds true only for the client socket, which connects to the
known server port.

Filter out any traffic that is not egressing from the client socket in the
BPF program that tests reading the dst_port.

Fixes: 8f50f16ff39d ("selftests/bpf: Extend verifier and bpf_sock tests for dst_port loads")
