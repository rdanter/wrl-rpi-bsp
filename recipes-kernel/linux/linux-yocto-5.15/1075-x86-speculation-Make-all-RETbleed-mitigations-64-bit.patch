Subject: [PATCH] x86/speculation: Make all RETbleed mitigations 64-bit only

commit b648ab487f31bc4c38941bc770ea97fe394304bb upstream.

The mitigations for RETBleed are currently ineffective on x86_32 since
entry_32.S does not use the required macros.  However, for an x86_32
target, the kconfig symbols for them are still enabled by default and
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/retbleed will wrongly report
that mitigations are in place.

Make all of these symbols depend on X86_64, and only enable RETHUNK by
default on X86_64.
