Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2712: Move /soc/sound to bcm2712-rpi

The /soc/sound node is not a feature of the bcm2712 hardware, rather a
Raspberry Pi convention of where to declare soundcards. Move it to
bcm2712-rpi.dtsi accordingly, at the same time marking it as disabled
so that runtime overlay application causes the soundcard device to be
created.
