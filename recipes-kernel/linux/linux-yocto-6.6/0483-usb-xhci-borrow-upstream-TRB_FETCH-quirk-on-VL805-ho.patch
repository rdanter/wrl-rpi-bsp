Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: borrow upstream TRB_FETCH quirk on VL805 hosts

This reimplements 5a57342 usb: xhci: add VLI_TRB_CACHE_BUG quirk

The downstream implementation required a fair bit of driver surgery to
allow for truncated ring segments, which needed to shrink by a small
amount to avoid the cache prefetcher from reading off the end of one
segment and into another.

An upstream implementation for a similar bug on a different controller
just doubles the size of the memory allocated for ring segments, which
is a bit more wasteful (+4K per allocation) but means less code churn.
